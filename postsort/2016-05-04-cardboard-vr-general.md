Today it&#8217;s time to discuss a bit on VR side. Specifically the Cardboard Google principle one of which is manifested in this [Viewmaster](http://www.view-master.com/en-gb)¬†which I have been testing at home.

Ok by itself VR is absolutely great and interesting, especially the likes of HTC Vive and specifically **Oculus Rift.¬†**

The last one is especially doing a very good job regarding problems that plagued this industry from the time it got conceived as gaming periphery in times of old **<span style="color: #ff0000;">Virtual boy¬†</span>**<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">which only had Black and red lines to display the awesome 3D-ness.¬†</span></span>

Those problems consisted in big part to graphic fidelity, FPS &#8211; which need to be at least on 60FPS even better to optimum at least 90FPS to be as nice and gentle on the eyes as possible. Because if you don&#8217;t have enough frames per second your head will start to hurt, pretty soon, pretty fast.

And that&#8217;s what Oculus which is releasing consumer version nova days is really good in. Creating a product on verge of the cutting edge, with game pipeline (Own and 3rd party) that appropriately utilizes¬†the technology.

I really see VR as it seems to be in current state of affairs and projected road ahead, times look great for all enthusiasts that were awaiting this day for last 30 years! Or even worse, thought before this day will never come üôÅ And it is here to stay!

But let&#8217;s go back on what I wanted to mention on the start. I was playing quite a bit with Viewmaster Virtuality headset recently and tried few demos through [Cardboard app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.cardboarddemo)¬†and also added few separate apps such as InCell VR and VR Roller coaster.

In short, experience was very interesting and lovely for exploring short sequences of new places and horizons, but my head started to hurt in literally minutes, and just the memory of using it brings my headache back inside my head somehow. But the experience I had with Octorunner and Xbox Kinects connected for body movement and Oculus VR on my head, that was truly mind blowing experience.

Summary:

Smartphone cardboard experiences are cool for a quick look and test of VR, but it doesn&#8217;t compare to true VR and brings bad symptoms to testers too fast maybe. But it helps bringing VR to a wider crowd and bringing the Brand, well not so much a Brand than the concept itself to a wider audience.
