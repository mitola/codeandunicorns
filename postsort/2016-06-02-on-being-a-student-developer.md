What are some of the interesting benefits you can get as a student on the world wide web, and how it may concern you as inspired young developer who will become an awesome entrepreneur in no time.

Is there something out there lying in the riches of tomorrow?

## [Github developer pack for students:](https://education.github.com/pack)

From private Github repositories for free, since you are beloved student, to a year of domain and hosting with NameCheap, and bunch of discounts from various different Clouders like Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. If you like your mails, mail everyone with SendGrid, also dear worker Travis CI will be available for your automated builds.

And if you are game dav Unreal engine is also an option.

But while I have mentioned game engines let&#8217;s look at something which is not just for students but can quite freely fall into it.

## [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/)

Unity3D offers no-pay license with export to pretty decent amount of platforms for all games under 100.000 dollars revenue. I think that may be total not yearly if I remember correctly, but I may be corrected if needed. Unity 3D is a very good engine with a relative low entry level of knowledge but at the same time offers very good working experience all the way to medium size studios. Even Hearthstone for example was made in Unity.

## [Professional developer tools from JetBrains (Free for students)](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)

PHP dev? No problem, PhpStorm is there for you.

Java dev and enterprise Java EE, jsps, freeemarker? IntelliJ IDEA

C#,C++ etc. whatever your heart desires. You probably heard of IntelliJ before, many people think of it as an excellent IDE, of course that doesn&#8217;t mean everyone, but lots of people really like it and it&#8217;s possible you will too. With very nice tools for devs, code completion etc etc. Simply amazing. If you want some alternatives though, check Netbeans,Atom,Sublime. Maybe even eMacs?

## [Visual studio Community for Students](https://www.dreamspark.com/student/)

Visual studio for students, free if you are one. So that&#8217;s about it. A nice selection of tools and plugins for your Microsoft ecosystem.
