A highlight on a very recent DDOS attack from &#8220;We live security&#8221; blog:

<http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/11/04/colossal-ddos-attack-liberia-wipes-majority-country-offline/>{._blanktarget}

A highlight on the bot-net used in the attack from &#8220;Medium&#8221; site:

<https://medium.com/@networksecurity/shadows-kill-mirai-ddos-botnet-testing-large-scale-attacks-sending-threatening-messages-about-6a61553d1c7#.3uen29nmd>

And their excerpt on Liberia:

&#8220;Over the past week we’ve seen continued short duration attacks on infrastructure in the nation of Liberia. Liberia has one internet cable, installed in 2011, which provides a single point of failure for internet access. From monitoring we can see websites hosted in country going offline during the attacks — additionally, a source in country at a Telco has confirmed to a journalist they are seeing intermittent internet connectivity, at times which directly match the attack. The attacks are extremely worrying because they suggest a Mirai operator who has enough capacity to seriously impact systems in a nation state.&#8221;

Based on the recent attack that happened in Liberia with a DDOS attack that jammed the only main internet cable going into the country it effectively put the country offline for an extended period of time.

This exposes and helps you to imagine what is the impact, or could be in different kind of economy where even more infrastructure is wound up in direct inter-connectivity.

It also highlights the problem that we will probably see more and more in the near future regarding the use of IoT (Internet of things devices) such as cameras,fridges, and other internet connected devices with some or a bigger portion of them having weaker security.  In general its better to have weaker processing power due to sheer number of IoT devices that they are utilising with multitude of the broadband access since it is dispersed over wider interconnected bot network than having smaller number of PC&#8217;s or similar with more processing but less broadband and due to the fact that PC&#8217;s have better security as well.

Since Liberia has only one internet cable connecting them to the rest of the world, due to the attack they turned country practically offline, which if you take a look at it, for example be it to happen to a more advanced network with more inter connectivity, it can cause even greater havoc, from potentially traffic networks to more and more.

What are your thoughts on this? And what could be potentially the best mitigation techniques to milden the effect of this kind of situations?
