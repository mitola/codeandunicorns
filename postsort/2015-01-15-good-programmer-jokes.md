    <h3><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234075/what-is-your-best-programmer-joke"><strong>Hot air ballon ride</strong></a></h3>
    A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes he’s lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts to get directions, "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"
    
    The man below says: "Yes. You're in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field."
    
    "You must work in Information Technology," says the balloonist.
    
    I do" replies the man. "How did you know?
    
    Well," says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically correct, but It's of no use to anyone.
    
    The man below replies, "You must work in management."
    
    "I do," replies the balloonist, "But how'd you know?"*
    
    Well", says the man, "you don’t know where you are or where you’re going, but you expect me to be able to help. You’re in the same position you were before we met, but now it’s my fault.

    <h3><strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234075/what-is-your-best-programmer-joke">Programmer and project manager on a trip</a></strong></h3>
    A young Programmer and his Project Manager board a train headed through the mountains on its way to Wichita. They can find no place to sit except for two seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother. After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young programmer are interested in each other, because they are giving each other looks. Soon the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a sound of a kiss followed by the sound of a slap.
    
    When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without saying a word. The grandmother is thinking to herself, “It was very brash for that young man to kiss my granddaughter, but I’m glad she slapped him.”
    
    The Project manager is sitting there thinking, “I didn’t know the young tech was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn’t missed him when she slapped me!”
    
    The young woman was sitting and thinking, “I’m glad the guy kissed me, but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!”
    
    The young programmer sat there with a satisfied smile on his face. He thought to himself, “Life is good. How often does a guy have the chance to kiss a beautiful girl and slap his Project manager all at the same time!”

    <h3><strong><a href="http://www.devtopics.com/best-programming-jokes/">Programmer and a genie</a></strong></h3>
    A programmer is walking along a beach and finds a lamp. He rubs the lamp, and a genie appears. “I am the most powerful genie in the world. I can grant you any wish, but only one wish.”
    
    The programmer pulls out a map, points to it and says, “I’d want peace in the Middle East.”
    
    The genie responds, “Gee, I don’t know. Those people have been fighting for millennia. I can do just about anything, but this is likely beyond my limits.”
    
    The programmer then says, “Well, I am a programmer, and my programs have lots of users. Please make all my users satisfied with my software and let them ask for sensible changes.”
    
    At which point the genie responds, “Um, let me see that map again.”
    
    &nbsp;
    <h3><strong><a href="http://www.devtopics.com/best-programming-jokes/"> Satan vs Jesus in coding!</a></strong></h3>
    Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer. This goes on for a few hours until they come to an agreement to hold a contest with God as the judge. They set themselves before their computers and begin. They type furiously, lines of code streaming up the screen, for several hours straight.
    
    Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes, taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over. He asks Satan to show his work. Visibly upset, Satan cries and says, “I have nothing. I lost it all when the power went out.”
    
    “Very well,” says God, “let us see if Jesus has fared any better.”
    
    Jesus presses a key, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers.
    
    Satan is astonished. He stutters, “B-b-but how?! I lost everything, yet Jesus’ program is intact! How did he do it?”
    
    God chuckles, “Everybody knows… Jesus saves.”

    A manager, a mechanical engineer, and software programmer are driving back from convention through the mountains. Suddenly, as they crest a hill, the brakes on the car go out and they fly careening down the mountain. After scraping against numerous guardrails, they come to a stop in the ditch. Everyone gets out of the car to assess the damage.
    
    The manager says, "Let's form a group to collaborate ideas on how we can solve this issue."
    
    The mechanical engineer suggests, "We should disassemble the car and analyze each part for failure."
    
    The software programmer says, "Let's push it back up the hill and see if it does it again."
