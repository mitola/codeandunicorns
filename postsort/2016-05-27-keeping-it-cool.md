    Last time I decided to write a bit my (little) experiences <a href="https://codeandunicorns.com/getting-started-on-bitcoin-trading/">trading</a> in bitcoin. Today I'll pick up where I left, specifically when one wants to find the best practices to enter and exit the market.
    
    It often seems easy to get some extra money by trading. You may start out with small amounts, get a few good deals and proceed to bid more and more. Getting a few winning streaks is not uncommon at all. The more I discuss with new traders or more experienced ones it's indeed "easy" to win, all you have to do is understand the trend, right?
    
    The worse is when one finds himself in a losing position. You might be losing a few bucks, but the market keeps going down, yet you still think you did everything right, nothing was different than before so you hold on and hope for the best. Down, down... down it goes - "Oops" - there goes the money you won in a few winning trades - "It's all good, it'll come back". But... no. Suddenly you're losing a significant amount of cash and it hurts to watch. Well, now you start understanding why it's a <b>risky</b> business.
    
    "What would the pros do?" - That's the question a curious person does when it decides trading might be an interesting way of making an extra buck with little effort. And a legitimate one to be fair considering the rollercoaster experience a newbie might feel after a few trades. There are so many people making a living trading all kinds of stuff so for sure there are a few guaranteed ways of winning, otherwise how could the traders survive.
    
    So you decide it's time to learn: patterns, oscillators, RSI, momentum, volume, stochastics... There's a whole world of tools to help a person understand trend shifts. Should you learn all of them? Ok, not really. But maybe if I learn a few it'll be better than nothing. Well after a few more trading sessions you realize your balance is a bit better but still you're not quite there, you still run into losing trades and everything you think about is:
    <blockquote>"Imagine I was trading with millions, I would probably be losing 2-5% in just a few hours taking the position I just did. What did I do wrong? Why didn't the market move as I expected? The indicators were there!"</blockquote>
    These are dangerous thoughts, mainly because you start thinking the market "owes" you something because the indicators were there and then it moved the opposite direction, you can't help but feeling betrayed and keep wondering "what would the pros do?" again and again. So you decide to reach out and discuss with other traders, what's their strategy? Are they being successful? How do they cope with loss? Do they have any hints on what's coming next? It sure feels comforting knowing you're not alone and that there's <b>social proof</b> of others making the same decisions. So now not only you are looking at god-knows-how-many indicators you're also taking other's opinion on your business, what could go wrong? Well everything. You're probably taking biased hints to cope with the responsibility and you're taking way less positions or none at all because <i>the stars are not aligned</i>, you don't want to lose money anymore...and... the market goes up and up - "Darn it! I lost the train again".
    
    I have felt this before and I've seen others going through the same path and yet I still stand confident thinking that it's fun to trade where others have given up. Personally I believe it's interesting to see the psychology involved in the "community" so to speak and these are some of the topics I've been reading about recently. Turns out there is no 100% guaranteed way of winning every time unless you know something others do not. Which has happened plenty of times in Wall Street by the way even though there are whole organizations such as the SEC to counter fraud or any kind of information abuse. Experienced traders go through the same pain on losing trades as any other and they use similar tools to assist their trading decisions, they might have access to some different sources than the newbies in some areas and they might have intricate strategies to help them win but they're no <i>unicorns</i>.
    
    More experienced traders know taking other's opinion is a dangerous effort, they know it's often biased and that it should be taken lightly. They know the market doesn't owe them nothing. Yes, nothing! There's no reason to feel betrayed when you take the wrong turn or resent anything else beside the decision you just took, so you must behave as a normal adult and take responsibility for the loss. It's important to keep the emotions in check, being able to detach and keep being clear about the mistakes. Looking at them working almost feels like the first days when you start trading, no concerns and certainty of the actions. There's no resentment, if things go badly deal with it, look back and see where you failed and move on.
    
    Bottomline is be careful of the positions you take but be confident and avoid being emotional. Taking responsibility is important and always bid what you feel confident. If you chill and look at the big picture and have a clear mind when looking at the numbers you'll see you'll stay positive in every way.
