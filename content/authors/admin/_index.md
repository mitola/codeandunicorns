Matjaz Trcek is an avid traveller, SRE, and a person that sometimes
dabbles into writting fiction and poetry. 

I like to cover multitude of topics such as electronics, 
different quirky projects for which I sometimes wonder, why not? 
And topics that will hopefully help some people with their own proffesional struggles.
